# Butterfly
## History


1. Our data support the hypothesis that butterflies originated in the Americas in the late Cretaceous, 
100 million years after the origin of angiosperms, and that they first fed on legumes. 
2. **Butterflies dispersed from the Americas to the *Eastern* Palaearctic across Beringia 
~75 Ma before diversifying in the Palaeotropics.
